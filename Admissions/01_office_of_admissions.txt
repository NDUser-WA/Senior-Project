OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS
Statement of Purpose
Notre Dame University-Louaize (NDU) is a Lebanese non-profit, private, Catholic institution of
Higher Education modeled on the American liberal arts system of higher education. Guided by
the cultural and spiritual heritage of the Maronite Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary, founded
in 1695 and a pioneer in education, NDU emphasizes promoting human dignity. The religious
affiliation of the University does not entail any sectarian obligation: applicants are granted
equal opportunity irrespective of nationality, ethnicity, gender, disability, or religious affiliation.
By promoting its academic and administrative facets and by recruiting students from local,
regional, and international provenance, the Office of Admissions aims to enhance the
universal image of NDU, an institution where all can explore the horizons of positive plurality
within a rich human spectrum. Today, the seven Faculties at NDU continue to attract students
from around the world and cater to the labor market demands of Lebanon and the region.
