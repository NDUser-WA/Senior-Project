TRANSFER: FACULTY OF ENGINEERING (FE)
Students with a Lebanese Baccalaureate Part II in Sociology & Economics or Literature & Humanities cannot be directly admitted to FE. They may transfer after completing at least 12 sophomore-level (or higher) credits in Math/Physics/Chemistry with a minimum grade of “B” at NDU, along with meeting all other university transfer requirements.

The FE accepts transfer students based on seat availability and eligibility criteria. Transfer credit evaluations follow specified procedures and deadlines.

A. From ABET-Accredited Engineering Programs
Eligible if:
a. Enrolled in an ABET-accredited program.
b. Completed ≥12 credits with a GPA ≥2.0/4.0 (or 60/100 for French/European systems).
c. Eligible to continue at home institution, with no disciplinary action. Supporting documents may be required.
d. Submit a statement of years spent at home institution.

Credits may transfer for courses passed with grade C or higher.

B. From Officially Recognized Faculties of Engineering
Eligible if:
a. Enrolled in a Faculty of Engineering at a university recognized by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education.
b. Completed ≥12 credits with GPA ≥2.7/4.0 (or 70/100 for French/European systems).
c. Same conditions as in A.c and A.d.

Credits may transfer for courses passed with a grade B or higher (70/100 for French/European). FE may deny transfer for Core, Major, or Elective courses if learning outcomes are not met.

C. From Non-Engineering Majors at Recognized Institutions
Eligible if:
a. Completed ≥12 sophomore-level credits in Math/Physics/Chemistry with GPA ≥3.0/4.0.
b. Cumulative GPA ≥2.7/4.0 (or 70/100 for French/European systems).
c. Same conditions as in A.c and A.d.

Only students from science/architecture majors may transfer. Students from other majors must apply as new applicants; no credit transfer allowed.

Credits may transfer for courses with grade B or higher. Core Requirement credits are at the discretion of FE; Major and Elective credits only considered if from an ABET-accredited program.

Remedial Math Courses
Some majors may require a remedial Math course (in addition to English remedials) if the applicant does not meet the minimum composite score. Each major has specific remedial course and passing grade requirements.
