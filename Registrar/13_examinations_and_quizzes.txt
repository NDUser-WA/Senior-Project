EXAMINATIONS AND QUIZZES
All courses normally have written final examinations. Such examinations are not required
in seminars, field work, internship programs, studio courses, and senior projects, but
instructors may choose to give one.
Instructors must give a minimum of 2 quizzes and progress tests per course. If a student
misses a quiz for a legitimate reason acceptable to the instructor, he or she should
arrange for a make-up with the instructor within a maximum period of 2 weeks from the
date of the quiz.
Final examinations shall count for a maximum of 40% of the final grade. Those exams
should be comprehensive by nature. The remaining 60% account for quizzes, progress
projects, tests, term papers, and other requirements, as specified by the respective
Department. A minimum of 40% of the course evaluation should be known by students
prior to the official withdrawal deadline.
Different sections of the same course must be given a common departmental final examination.
