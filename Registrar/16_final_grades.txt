FINAL GRADES
A courseâ€™s final grades should be submitted to the Office of the Registrar within three
working days, or 72 hours, after the scheduled date of the examination for that course.
The instructor should submit the final grades online to the Department Chairperson, who
will in turn submit the grades to the Dean of the respective Faculty for final approval.
