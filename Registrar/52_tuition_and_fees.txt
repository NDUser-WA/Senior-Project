TUITION AND FEES
NDU is a non-profit institution. Tuition and fees paid by students represent a small
percentage of the full cost of a student’s education. The deficit is covered by income from
gifts, grants, and donations from foundations, alumni, and friends of the University. The
fees cover applications, membership in the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), and
the technology and student services fee. Membership of Lebanese students in the
NSSF is mandatory by law. Thus, prior to registration, students are urged to follow the
instructions given by the Office of Student Affairs, concerning clearance for the NSSF.

charged 25% of the registered credits;

charged any penalty on the condition that they maintain 12 undergraduate credits
