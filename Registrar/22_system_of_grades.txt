SYSTEM OF GRADES
The University uses the following system of grades. This system consists of letter grades
with their corresponding numerical ranges (i.e., percentage equivalent and the 4.0 point
maximum).
Grade Description Quality Percentage
 Point Value Equivalent
A+ Outstanding 4.0 97 - 100
A Excellent 4.0 93 - 96
A-- Very Good 3.7 89 - 92
B+ Good 3.3 85 - 88
B Good 3.0 80 - 84
B-- Good 2.7 77 - 79
C+ Satisfactory 2.3 73 - 76
C Satisfactory 2.0 70 - 72
C-- Passing 1.7 66 - 69
D+ Passing 1.3 63 - 65
D Lowest Passing 1.0 60 - 62
F Failure 0.0 0 - 59
UW Unofficial Withdrawal The “UW” grade is assigned by the instructor when a
registered student has never attended a class or has ceased
attending and has not submitted an official course withdrawal
request to the Office of the Registrar. This grade is computed
as an “F” grade in the GPA.

W Official Withdrawal The “W” grade indicates withdrawal without academic
penalty. This grade is issued by the Office of the Registrar only
to students submitting an official course withdrawal form by
the scheduled deadline. The grade “W” is not computed in the
student’s GPA and may not be changed to any other grade
under any circumstances.

PR Progress, Re-enroll The “PR” grade is a provisional grade, and hence it is not
computed in the student’s GPA. It is used to reflect progress
on continuing research efforts for the senior study, or the
senior research, or design project or internship course until it
is completed a grade of “PR” could remain on the student
transcript two consecutive regular semesters, after which a
different grade should be assigned. Otherwise, the “PR”
grade will automatically turn into “F”.

U Audit The “U” grade indicates that the individual was an auditor
or listener in the course. This does not have any quality point
value, credits nor a written statement can be given for a class
audited, and no instructor is authorized to admit anyone as an
auditor to any of his or her classes unless the individual has
registered as such.

I Incomplete The “I” grade is a provisional grade, and hence it is not
computed in the student’s GPA. It indicates that the student
has for good and justified reasons not completed all course
requirements, but there is a reasonable expectation that he/
she will successfully complete it. If this provisional grade is
unresolved by the end of the 8th week of the following
semester, the Office of the Registrar will automatically
 convert it to the grade of “F.” The grade will then be computed
in the student’s GPA. However, students who are out of
attendance in the semester following the one in which the
course was taken have one year to complete the work.
Degree candidates should be aware that an “I” grade
received during the last semester in any of the courses
required for graduation will automatically result in the
postponement of graduation.

P Pass “P” indicates a passing performance in a course taken in a
Pass/No Pass. The credits, if any will be added to the number
of credits passed, but will not be included in the average. It
has no quality points.
NP No Pass “NP” indicates a failing performance in courses taken on a
Pass/No Pass basis. No credits will be added to the student’s
record, nor will the average will be affected. It has no quality
points.
