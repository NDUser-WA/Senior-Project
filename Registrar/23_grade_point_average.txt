GRADE POINT AVERAGE
The Grade point average (GPA) or index is the ratio of the total quality point values divided
by the number of the credit hours attempted by the student, as shown below.
Course Number Grade Credit Hours Quality Point Total Quality
& Designation Earned Attempted Values Point Values
ARB 211 B+ 3 × 3.3 = 9.9
MGT 425 A 4 × 4 = 16
HUT 305 D 3 × 1 = 3
MAT 215 F 3 × 0 = 0
CSC 200 C- 1 × 1.7 = 1.7
14 30.6
The GPA of the five courses would then be:
which is equivalent to a grade of “C.” Students are expected to know how to compute
their own GPA. Courses with a grade of “W,” “U,” “PR,” or “I” are not counted in
computing the cumulative GPA. The same applies to all transfer courses. Hence, grades
for work done at institutions other than NDU are not included in the GPA. Only courses
and credits may be transferred. Thus, the cumulative GPA is an average of all the credit
hours attempted by the student at NDU.
