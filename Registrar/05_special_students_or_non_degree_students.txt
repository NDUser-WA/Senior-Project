SPECIAL STUDENTS OR NON-DEGREE STUDENTS
Undergraduate students who are taking courses at NDU for credits but not working toward
a degree are considered “Special Students” or “Non-Degree Students.” Non-Degree
Students shall be accepted on a semester-to-semester basis. Initial applications shall be
made through the Office of Admissions and thereafter through the Office of the Registrar.
Such students shall meet the academic standards required of degree students and shall be
permitted neither to audit courses nor be qualified for any category of financial aid.
