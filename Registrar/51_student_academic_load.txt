STUDENT ACADEMIC LOAD
Full-Time and Part-Time Loads
Registration in at least 12 credits for the Fall or Spring semester constitutes a full-time
load for an undergraduate student. Otherwise, it constitutes a part-time load.
Maximum Load for Registration per Semester
The maximum load for registration during the Fall or Spring semester by any undergraduate
student is either 17 credits or the number of credits specified in his or her suggested
program for that particular semester. Students in good academic standing, however, can
take up to 19 credits per semester provided that this number of credits does not contradict
any residency requirements. Students with a cumulative GPA of 3.50 and above may
petition to register for one additional 3-credit course over and above the regular load. This
additional load may be approved provided the residency requirements are met.
The maximum load for registration for Engineering students is specified in their suggested
program.
Maximum Load for Registration in the Summer Session
The maximum load for registration by any undergraduate student in the Summer session
is 9 credits or less, as determined by the Faculty concerned.
Maximum Load for Students on Probation
Students who are on probation may register for a maximum of 13 credits per semester, of
which at least 9 credits from courses that must be repeated, if any.
Maximum Load for Students with Incomplete(s)
Students who have 2 or more incomplete grades from a previous semester or the Summer
session may register for a maximum of 15 credits per semester on the condition that the
student has good academic standing.
Maximum Load for Students with Cross-Registration
The combined load for students with both registration at NDU and cross-registration in
another institution must not exceed the maximum load stated above.
