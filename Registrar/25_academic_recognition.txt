ACADEMIC RECOGNITION
There are two kinds of academic recognition:
1. Dean’s Honor List:
Full-time students who obtain a semester GPA of 3.20/4.00 or higher with no incomplete
grades during a given semester are placed on the Dean’s List for that semester. These
students are invited to attend the Dean’s Luncheon held in their honor.
2. Graduation with Distinction:
An undergraduate student with high academic achievement will graduate with:
• Cum Laude (Distinction), if the cumulative GPA falls between 3.20/4.0 and
 3.49/4.0;
• Magna Cum Laude (High Distinction), if the cumulative GPA falls between
 3.50/4.0 and 3.79/4.0; and
• Summa Cum Laude (Highest Distinction), if the cumulative GPA is 3.80/4.0 or above.
Such distinctions appear on the student’s transcript and degree. A transfer undergraduate
student is only eligible for these distinctions if he or she has completed at least 50% of
degree requirements.
