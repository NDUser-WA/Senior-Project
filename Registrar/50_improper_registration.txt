IMPROPER REGISTRATION
Only students officially enrolled in a class are allowed to attend the class. The instructor
of the class should inform any non-officially enrolled student of his or her improper
registration and should immediately report it, in writing, to the Office of the Registrar, and
should also ask the student to immediately proceed to the Office of the Registrar for a
settlement.
