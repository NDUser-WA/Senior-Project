HOURS OF CLASSES
Usually, classes are held Monday through Friday. Some classes, however, may be
exceptionally held on Saturdays to make up for missed sessions or to schedule exams.
During regular semesters, classes start at 8:00 a.m. and end at 9:00 p.m., with some 4-credit
courses starting at 7:30 a.m. instead. During the Summer session, classes start at 8:00 a.m.
