ACADEMIC STANDING

Undergraduate students at NDU fall into one of four academic standing categories:

1. Good Academic Standing:
A student is in good standing if their cumulative GPA meets the following thresholds:

Credits Attempted | Minimum GPA
------------------|-------------
1–12 cr.          | 1.50
13–24 cr.         | 1.75
25+ cr.           | 2.00

2. Academic Probation:
A student is placed on probation if their cumulative GPA falls below the required threshold for their credit range.

3. Academic Suspension:
A student on probation for three consecutive semesters is suspended. The third probation counts as the suspension, even if the student is not registered. One final semester is granted to improve GPA.

- If GPA remains below the threshold:
  - **Option 1: Petition for Reconsideration**
    - GPA 1.80–1.99 → Suspension may be withheld; one more semester granted.
    - GPA ≤ 1.79 → Suspension upheld; may register in another NDU Faculty. Reinstatement possible after one semester with:
      - Cumulative GPA ≥ 2.0
      - GPA > 2.0 on 12+ relevant credits

  - **Option 2: Study at Another Institution**
    - With written advisor and Chair approval, student may register at another university.
    - Reinstatement possible if GPA ≥ 2.0 on 12+ relevant credits (grades ≥ C). Credits may transfer, but grades are not calculated in GPA.

4. Academic Dismissal:
A student is dismissed if:
- They fail to meet GPA requirements after reinstatement, or
- They fail to maintain good standing after suspension was previously removed by the Dean.
