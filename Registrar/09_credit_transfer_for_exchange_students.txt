CREDIT TRANSFER FOR EXCHANGE STUDENTS
The Office of International Relations (OIR) at NDU will work with the student to negotiate a
suitable program, with credits transferable to his or her Home Institution. The student will
need to work hard on this part of the process at his or her Home Institution but should not
expect to have it completely finished until he or she is back at NDU.
When the student finishes his or her study in the student exchange program at NDU,
the student will be issued an official transcript of the courses completed and the grades
achieved. It is, however, the student’s responsibility to obtain his or her transcript. Therefore,
follow-up on the attainment of the transcript of grades is the student’s responsibility.
