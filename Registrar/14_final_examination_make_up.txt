FINAL EXAMINATION MAKE-UP
If a student misses a final examination for a legitimate reason, he or she will receive an
incomplete grade, designated “I”. The student shall arrange for a make-up examination with
the course instructor. Once a date is agreed upon, the student shall pay the University a
make-up final examination fee. Consequently, the make-up final examination shall be taken
no later than the 8th week of the following academic semester. In the case where a change
of grade is not received by the Office of the Registrar within the set period, a grade of “F”
shall be given for that course.
