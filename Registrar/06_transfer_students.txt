TRANSFER STUDENTS
Credits transferred from institutions of higher education that are recognized by the
Lebanese Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) are accepted provided that
the Department and Faculty concerned ensure that the credits accepted are applicable to
the corresponding degree program. The accepted credit, however, does not count toward
the student’s GPA at NDU. The criteria established by NDU regarding this policy are made
available to students through the University website and Catalog.
Depending on the Faculty, a transfer student is required to complete at least 50% of the
degree requirements at NDU in order to be eligible for a degree, while the remainder of
the credits that are taken at other institutions of higher education can be transferred if
they satisfy the criteria of the Department and Faculty concerned.
For the Architecture and FE students, a maximum of 20 credits of major courses may
be transferred as per MEHE decision and NDU rules and regulations. In addition to LAC
deemed “equivalent” to those required at NDU.
Students must fulfill a minimum residency requirement of 125 credits.
