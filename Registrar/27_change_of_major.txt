CHANGE OF MAJOR
1. Within a Faculty
To be eligible for a change of major within the same faculty, the student must meet the
requirements for admission to the new major. He or she must submit an e- petition for
a change of major. The request for the student’s admission is considered by the new
Department and by the Dean concerned.
• New students are eligible to change major upon the completion of their first semester.
2. To a Different Faculty
A student moving into another Faculty within the University is considered a new student
by the new Faculty. The student is required to fill in an e- petition for a change of major.
3. By University Action
A student may be asked to change his or her major for any of the following reasons:
• If he or she is on probation and fails at the end of a semester or Summer session in
two or more of his or her major and/or core courses; and
• If he or she fails to pass a major course after having repeated it twice.
