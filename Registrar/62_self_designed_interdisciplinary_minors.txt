SELF-DESIGNED INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS

NDU lets students create their own Self-Designed Interdisciplinary Minor by collaborating with Faculties and the Office of the Registrar.

Proposal Guidelines:

1. Student chooses a title and develops a rationale with their academic advisor and one advisor from each relevant department.

2. Rationale must show an intellectually coherent, focused study plan.

3. Submit application and rationale to an ad-hoc committee of Chairs and Deans formed by the Dean of the student’s Faculty.

4. The committee meets with the student and advisors to discuss the proposal, may request modifications, then approve or reject it.

Rules and Regulations:

1. Minor must differ substantially from existing minors (less than 50% overlap).

2. Minor must be 15–21 credits.

3. Up to 6 credits may be completed before approval.
