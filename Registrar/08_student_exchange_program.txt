STUDENT EXCHANGE PROGRAM
An exchange program is a unique feature of international universities wherein a student
may apply for a site transfer in any of the universities with which NDU shares an
academic collaboration or exchange agreement. The student exchange program is a
program coordinated by the Office of International Relations (OIR), a unit that reports to
the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA). The objective of the student exchange
program is to promote international attentiveness and construct effective partnerships
with established universities and educational institutions. A student exchange program
will provide academic and intellectual benefit through the exchange of students between
NDU and respective institutions that are party to a formal Exchange Agreement or a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/Cooperation.
• OUTGOING EXCHANGE STUDENTS
NDU exchange students will be considered “outgoing students.” This does not mean,
however, that they are no longer NDU students. No matter how long the exchange
program may last, outgoing students will not receive a degree from the host
institution; they must return to NDU to receive their degree. That being said, outgoing
students must fulfill a set of requirements and complete an application to be eligible
for the student exchange program.
• INCOMING EXCHANGE STUDENTS
Who can be an incoming exchange student?
- Students who wish to study part of their degree at NDU and take all credits
achieved to their Home Institution; and

- Any student registered in a university that has a formal agreement with NDU which
explicitly covers student exchange.
