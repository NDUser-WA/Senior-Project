WITHDRAWAL FROM COURSES
Students may withdraw any time prior to the 14th week of the Fall or Spring semesters
and before the 28th day of the Summer session upon settling all due fees. Then a grade of
“W” will be inscribed on their records.
The third withdrawal will turn to “F” for any class from which students attempt to
withdraw.
The official withdrawal is processed by initiating the electronic drop and submitted it via
SIS.
Withdrawal after the deadline will result in an “F” or “UW” in the dropped course. No
withdrawal is allowed beyond this period unless the student submit an e-petition on SIS
due to urgent reasons.
