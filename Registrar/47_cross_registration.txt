CROSS-REGISTRATION
An NDU undergraduate student may be allowed to cross-register in a course at another
institution if:
• The course is not offered at NDU during the semester in which the student is
expected to graduate;
• The course in which the student intends to cross-register is equivalent to his or her
required course at NDU;
• The course does not conflict with his or her course schedule at NDU;
• The student has the Cross-Registration and Registration Forms signed by his or
her Department Chairperson and Academic Advisor as well as the Office of the
Registrar and the Business Office;
• The student returns the appropriate Cross-Registration form(s) to NDU’s Office of
the Registrar after officially registering at the other institution; and
• The student has to submit an official transcript of records for his or her crossregistered course to the Office of the Registrar at NDU.
A non-NDU undergraduate student may be allowed to cross-register in a course at NDU
upon submission of a written authorization from his or her institution allowing him or
her to register for this course at NDU in accordance with the University Undergraduate
Registration Policy.
