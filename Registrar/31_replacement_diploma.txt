REPLACEMENT DIPLOMA
NDU will provide a replacement diploma in situations where the original is lost or
destroyed. The replacement diploma must be ordered online and/or in person by filling
a form available at the Office of the Registrar. An “Authorization Form” is required to be
filled if the graduate wants someone else to pick up the replacement diploma on his or
her behalf. Each replacement diploma follows the current diploma format and includes
a notation stating that the diploma is a replacement of the original. The replacement
diploma will bear the date of its preparation and will annotate the date of the lost/
destroyed original. All replacement diplomas bear the signatures of the current
University President, Faculty Dean, and Registrar.
