GRADES UPON CHANGE OF MAJOR
1. Upon approval of change of major, all grades on transferable or non-transferable
courses taken by a student in his or her old major/area of concentration remain part of
his or her official transcripts. Unlike the transferable grades, the non-transferable ones
are not computed in the studentâ€™s GPA for the new major and are not counted toward
the total number of credits required for graduation for the new major. A student
cannot ask for a non-transferable course to be computed back in his or her GPA.
2. The students who benefited from the above rule (#1) cannot return to their old major,
and cannot request to have their major changed again to any major, which requires a
non-transferable course grade and which was deleted from his or her GPA.
