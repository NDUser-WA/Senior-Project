AUDITORS
An auditor is a student who has been admitted to the course(s) after having satisfied the
requirements for admission to this course as deemed appropriate by the Department
concerned. He or she is required to pay 75% of the course(s) fees. Once an auditor is
registered, he or she cannot change his or her status back to credit. Grades and credits will
not be given for auditing course(s) and hence cannot be counted for financial aid purposes.
However, they are entitled to a statement of enrollment upon request.
