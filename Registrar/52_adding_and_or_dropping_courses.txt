ADDING AND/OR DROPPING COURSES
A student may add or drop a course or change a section in his or her registration schedule
during the Drop/Add day only. This can be done by:
• A student may drop or add a course(s) independently via SIS or at the office of the
Academic Advisor;
• In the Drop/Add period, two modifications are allowed by the student;
• In case a section is closed, or a student wishes to wave prerequisites/corequisites
and the like, only during Drop/Add period he or she has to fill in a Drop/Add form to
secure the signature of the Coordinator or Chairperson and or Dean concerned; and
• Receive his or her modified tuition statement from the Business Office.
