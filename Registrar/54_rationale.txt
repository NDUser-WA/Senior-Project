RATIONALE
The objective of establishing undergraduate academic minors, hereafter called minors,
at NDU is to offer a wide, versatile, and creative spectrum of basic knowledge for
students in areas other and their major programs of study, an objective that is in line with
the American liberal arts model of higher education. Additionally, establishing minors
enhances the appeal of the Departments and Faculties in terms of allowing them to offer
relatively quick training or specialization programs to interested students.
The establishment of undergraduate academic minors is a matter that is internal to the
University and is outside the scope of governmental licensing and recognition.
The following rules and regulations do not allow students to enroll in the University for the
sole purpose of pursuing minor studies.
