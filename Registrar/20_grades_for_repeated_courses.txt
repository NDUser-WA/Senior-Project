GRADES FOR REPEATED COURSES
Students must repeat courses for which they got a grade of “F,” “UW,” or those courses
for which they did not get the required passing grade set by the relevant Department or
Faculty, in the case where these courses are required in the major. Students must repeat
these courses immediately the next time they are offered. For a repeated course, the
highest grade will be computed into the GPA. The other grades are kept on the student’s
transcript. A course may be repeated only twice. The letter “R” will be placed on the
student’s transcript next to the course being repeated.
