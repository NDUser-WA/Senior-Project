CHANGE OF GRADE
Once a student’s grade for a course is reported by the Faculty and submitted by the Dean,
it shall be final in the absence of justified circumstances. Under justifiable circumstances,
to change a grade, the course instructor is required to fill out and sign a “Change of Grade
Form.” All supporting documents should be attached to the form. Once the Department
Chairperson approves the new grade, it is forwarded to the Faculty Dean for final action
and then resubmitted to the Office of the Registrar for processing, all within five working
days.
Only under force majeure would a student’s case be considered beyond those five
working days. In this event, the student may submit an e-petition for re-evaluation of his
or her final grade in a particular course.
No case will be considered after a lapse of one semester.
